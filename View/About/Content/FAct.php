                <h3>Are you affiliated with Riot Games ?</h3>
                <ul><li>Our site uses the <a href="https://developer.riotgames.com/">Riot Games API</a> to authenticate users and gather their games. However, we have no direct affiliation with Riot Games, and we're simply a community of gamers that are fans of PC gaming and League of Legends.</li></ul>
                <h3>What are the requirements for registering ?</h3>
                <ul><li>Anyone can sign-up on Challenge Wars, however, you will need a valid League of Legends account to join challenges. You can link your League of Legends account from your <a href="<?php echo $_SITE_INDEX_ . $_LINK_SYNC_; ?>">account page</a>. We have this requirement in place to prevent users from registering multiple accounts.</li>
                </ul><h3>How do you validate my League of Legends account ?</h3>
                <ul><li>We use the Riot Games API to retrieve the names of your rune pages. You will have to rename one of them to a random code that we will give you.</li>
                </ul><h3>I changed my Summoner Icon on League of Legensd, why is my old one still in use by your site?</h3>
                <ul><li>User data is automatically updated and synced on a regular basis, but you can <a href="<?php echo $_SITE_INDEX_ . $_LINK_SYNC_; ?>">force a sync</a> to instantly update your Summoner Icon.</li>

                </ul><hr><h2>Challenges</h2>
                <h3>Who is creating all these challenges ?</h3>
                <ul><li>The challenge and prizes are provided by our community. Users manage their own challenges, choose when they start, when they end, and who is able to enter. Once the challenge ends, the creator is notified and receives the necessary information to contact the winner in order to send the prize.</li>
                </ul><h3>How do I take part in challenges ?</h3>
                <ul><li>If you browse our homepage, you'll see a listing of all challenges that are currently available for you to enter. Once you enter a challenge, you should read it's description.</li>
                </ul><h3>What are Challenge Points (CP)?</h3>
                <ul><li>Challenge Points are used for entering Advanced Challenges. The number of points required to enter a challenge varies, and depends on the prize offered. </li>
                </ul><h3>How do I receive or earn more Challenge Points (CP)?</h3>
                <ul><li>All users start with a set amount of points. You can then earn more points by joining and participating in Starter Challenges. You can also buy Challenge Points in our <a href="">shop</a>.</li>
                </ul><h3>How many Challenge Points (CP) can I receive?</h3>
                <ul><li>Users are limited to 100 points at any given time.</li>
                </ul><h3>Do I get Challenge Points (CP) back if I don't win?</h3>
                <ul><li>Challenge Points are used for a chance to win a better prize, and they're not returned if you do not win. If you choose to remove your entry from a challenge that's still open, the points will be returned to your account.</li>
                </ul><h3>If I win a prize, when can I expect to receive it?</h3>
                <ul><li>Challenge creators are allowed one week to send the gift after the challenge has ended. Depending on the type of challenge and prize, you might receive it directly on the site, or the challenge creator might have sent you a friend request on League of Legends to gift you. Please remain patient, and do not contact the challenge creator during this time. If the gift is not received after one week, you can mark the prize as not received, and attempt to contact the challenge creator on League of Legends to follow-up.</li>
                </ul><h3>Why is there a limit to the number of gifts I'm able to give away?</h3>
                <ul><li>We limit the number of gifts a user can create for security purposes, and to prevent a new user from potentially posting a large number of invalid gifts to the site. When you create giveaways and your gifts are received, this number will increase, and you'll be rewarded with the ability to create giveaways with a greater number of copies, or more simultaneous giveaways.</li>
                </ul><h3>How do the different challenge types work when creating a giveaway?</h3>
                <ul><li><strong>Everyone</strong>
                        <ul><li>As the name suggests, these challenges are visible to everyone in the community.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                    <li><strong>Invite Only</strong>
                        <ul><li>These challenges are not publicly listed on the site, but rather remain hidden. Only users that know the URL of the challenge will be able to enter for a chance to win. This allows you to privately share the challenge link with friends, or outside communities.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                    <li><strong>Groups</strong>
                        <ul><li>This option allows you to limit the visibility of your giveaway to users of selected communities. When selecting multiple groups, users will only need to be a member of one of those groups in order to have permission to view and enter the challenge. Outside users will not be able to access the challenge, even if they know the URL.</li>
                        </ul></li>
